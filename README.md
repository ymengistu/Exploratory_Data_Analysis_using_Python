# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_using_Python
This repo contains python codes for coducting some important exploratory techniques: These Techniques include:
1) Recursive Feature Elimination
2) Synthetic Minority Oversampling( for imbalanced data)
3) feature selection-Univeriate analysis
4) correlation

Note that all or a combination of some of these method could be applied before applying a machine learning algorithm
